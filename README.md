## Welcome to my Data Portfolio! Here, you'll find a summary of my projects.

I'm a junior data analyst with a focus on business intelligence, marketing, and product analytics. In my projects, I use SQL, Google BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Azure Data Studio, and data visualization tools like Tableau, PowerBI, and Looker Studio. My work centers on transforming data into actionable insights that drive business growth.

I am also currently expanding my skills in Python, including Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, as well as exploring Amplitude and A/B testing.

Feel free to explore my projects or get in touch!
